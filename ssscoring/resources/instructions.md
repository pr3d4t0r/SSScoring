# Speed Skydiving Scoring

## To score one or more jumps

1. Set the starting/drop zone ground-level elevation in meters by **selecting
   the drop zone** name from the list or entering the value in the field **DZ
   elevation in meters**
1. Open one or more FlySight CSV files by clicking on the **Track files**
   upload button or drop the files in there
1. Wait a few seconds, the results will be displayed in the main window
1. When done, press the **Clear** button to remove all the track files from the
   uploader, or press the **x** control in the drop zone or elevation fields to
   wipe everything off and start over


## Main window

- The main window displays these instructions or the results of evaluating the
  track files
- Results are displayed in individual tabs
  - The first tab summarizes all the jumps input in the track files uploading
    box
  - Details of each jump appear in a dedicated tab, identified by the track
    file's name or "tag"


## Tips and tricks

- You can add or remove files from the track file uploader as you go, without
  having to clear every time; SSScore uses the DZ elevation to validate the
  jump but otherwise doesn't enforce if two track files come from the same DZ
- If you are running this from the web and leave the machine unattended for
  several minutes, the **Clear** and other buttons will stop responding because
  the cloud server went to sleep.  Press your browser's _Reload_ button to
  start a new session
- You can zoom in or out of the map views using expand/contract gestures on a
  trackpad, with the mouse, or pinching the screen of your mobile device
