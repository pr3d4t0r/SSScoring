Where: \- \f[CR]datalake\f[R] is a directory containing one or more
speed skydiving tracks, either in the topmost directory or nested.
\f[CR]ssscore\f[R] ignores all files present in the data lake that
aren\[cq]t speed skydives, even if they are FlySight\-compatible CSV
files.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-e\f[R] is drop zone elevation MSL in ft; defaults to 0.0;
\f[CR]x.y\f[R] is a floating point number.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-t\f[R] if present, generates training output rounded values
without decimals.
Many speeders prefer to report 481 instead of 480.731 or 482 instead of
482.297 for training logs.
